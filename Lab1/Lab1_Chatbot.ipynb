Before entering the loop, your program should prompt the user to request their input (e.g. \"Hi, how can I help you?\"). At each iteration of the loop, the program should take user input (typed onto the terminal pressing 'Enter' at the end) and then output simple statistical information about that input (e.g. \"You entered X letters and Y words\"). Also add a way to exit the loop; for example, if the user types \"Bye\" the loop should end and your program should halt after a final prompt to the user to acknowledge that the interaction has ended.

    "Next you will upgrade your chatbot to be a \"good listener.\" Do not worry about deleting or overwriting things you did in the previous step. Before entering into the interactive loop, your chatbot should ask the user's name and remember it throughout the chat. It should also prompt the user to talk about something (e.g. \"How was your day, Ashitaka?\") As part of the loop, the chatbot should analyze the user's input and decide whether to give a positive, negative, or neutral response. To analyze the input, we have supplied a fixed list of [positive](http://ptrckprry.com/course/ssd/data/positive-words.txt) and [negative](http://ptrckprry.com/course/ssd/data/negative-words.txt) words and which will determine the number of positive and negative words that occur in the user's input. For the most simple version of the `ListenBot`, your list of positive and negative words do not have to be too long, just enough to showcase a simple conversation. However, the lists we supply will make your `ListenBot` more robust. \n",

    "* Negative responses: \"Too bad!\" \"Womp, womp!\"\n",
